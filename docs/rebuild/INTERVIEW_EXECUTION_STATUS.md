# Interview implementation execution status

Authoritative plan: `INTERVIEW_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_2026-09-06.md`.
Approved for sequential implementation: 2026-09-06.

## Current position

- Phase 0 in progress: preserve baseline, run deterministic gates, then P0.1.
- Starting HEAD: `66eafc9` on `codex/interview-mobile`, QuesIQ-dev.
- Existing Interview mobile/Coaching/model-lab changes predate this execution.
  A checkpoint preserves them; it is not a fresh correctness certification.
- No schema change is part of P0.1. Database backup is mandatory before a later
  schema-changing task; it is not a prerequisite to this read-path change.
- No paid API, direct PC/emulator control, audio testing, push, or deployment.

## Task ledger

| Task | Status | Worker | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plan activation | Complete | Manager | Workspace/app AGENTS and docs map point to the approved roadmap and this status. |
| P0 baseline/checkpoint | In progress | Manager | Starting HEAD recorded; verify deterministic baseline and preserve existing scoped changes. |
| P0.1 direct owned review lookup | Not started | Planned Luna / low | Preserve response shape; test old record, foreign owner, missing ID, unauthenticated access. |
| P1.1 effective-mode/state contracts | Not started | Manager-led | Starts after P0 acceptance; no mode-engine promotion in configuration cleanup. |

## Resume rules

Read the active plan and this ledger, verify Git state, then continue the first
unaccepted task. Workers own only assigned files and may not stage/commit,
migrate, change dependencies, or run paid calls without explicit task scope.
Run targeted checks per task and combined gates before accepting a slice.
Record actual tests and limitations; never substitute browser evidence for
native voice/device proof. Keep test records isolated from learner progress.

Per-agent token/credit attribution is unavailable through the current worker
tool results; do not report an invented cost saving. Record model/effort and
correction rounds instead.
