# Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-22

## Current Focus

QuesIQ Interview has moved from the initial UI shell into the first direct
browser voice slice. The practice wizard now hands a session setup snapshot into
a focused session screen, and the direct OpenAI Realtime path works manually well
enough to prefer it over VAPI for the first coded browser beta. The first
Postgres launch record now lands before voice, and the Render deployment path is
being moved onto the active `quesiq-web` service.

## Done Since Last Handoff

- Refined responsive mobile and desktop app layouts.
- Added UI-only onboarding/interview context with required name/role and optional
  company, job description, and resume path.
- Split the interview UI into focused components and extracted practice types and
  seeded data.
- Added client-side session setup snapshot launch and focused session screen.
- Added direct OpenAI Realtime WebRTC voice session slice from the session screen.
- Added server-only API key path via `/api/realtime/session` and `.env.example`.
- Added Que first-turn kickoff after the data channel opens.
- Added browser readiness/live/ended/error states, clean session end handling,
  and a typed client artifact draft for transcript and lifecycle events.
- Chose Drizzle for Postgres schema/migrations and Auth.js for the auth slice.
- Added the first Drizzle Session migration plus `/api/sessions` launch creation
  before the voice screen opens.
- Added Session voice artifact persistence after an ended direct voice attempt:
  transcript turns, lifecycle events, start/end metadata, and direct Realtime
  call id are stored without storing audio.
- Added Auth.js GitHub sign-in scaffolding plus Drizzle auth tables and Session
  ownership enforcement for new Session creation, Realtime exchange, and voice
  artifact save.
- Added the first evaluation handoff from saved Session transcripts into an
  owned structured review with five score dimensions and a next action.
- Updated `render.yaml` with a free Blueprint path that provisions Postgres,
  wires `DATABASE_URL`, and runs Drizzle migrations before service start.
- Render was connected to Codex through Render MCP for service, deploy, log,
  Postgres, and environment-variable inspection.
- The existing paid Render service `quesiq-web` was repointed from the older
  Quira repo to `ronnieav8r/QuesIQ` for the active rebuild path.
- Render Postgres `quesiq-interview-db` was created and `quesiq-web` was wired
  to run `npm run db:migrate && npm start`.

## Verified

- ESLint passed.
- TypeScript check passed.
- Next production build passed.
- Render logs on 2026-05-22 showed the QuesIQ persistence deploy build
  succeeded, Drizzle migrations applied successfully, and Next started.
- Manual voice spike test passed:
  - Que speaks first after start.
  - Audio sounded natural enough.
  - Recent Realtime events appeared.
  - Transcript turns appeared for the user and Que.
  - Disconnect stopped the session cleanly.

## Important Current Decisions

- Living rebuild docs live in this Git repo under `docs/rebuild/`.
- Older OneDrive Bubble/rebuild files are reference copies, not a second source
  of truth unless intentionally resynced.
- Direct OpenAI Realtime is the preferred first browser voice path.
- VAPI is a fallback path, not the default path, while phone calls are out of
  scope.
- QuesIQ should own durable user context, session snapshots, transcript/artifact
  records, evaluation, history, and progression.

## Next Best Work

1. Deploy and verify the evaluation handoff on `quesiq-web`.
2. Verify review creation after an ended saved voice session.
3. Add the first owned session history/review routing after the review slice is
   live.
4. Keep verifying that `Launch Voice Session` creates a Session id before direct
   voice opens.

## Watch Outs

- A test `OPENAI_API_KEY` is currently stored locally in ignored `.env.local`;
  rotate the key after the spike/test cycle because it was shared in chat.
- The Render Postgres connection URL was pasted during setup; rotate that
  database credential after the wiring test and replace `DATABASE_URL`.
- Owned practice launch now requires Auth.js sign-in after this auth slice
  deploys. GitHub OAuth needs `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`,
  `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`, and Render trusted host configuration before deploy QA.
- Localhost preview is deprecated on any port in this Codex environment until
  we intentionally invest time to fix it. Prefer deploy-based or
  user-confirmed QA instead.
- Render currently also has a separate free `quesiq-interview-rebuild` web
  service. Decide whether to keep, suspend, or remove it after `quesiq-web` is
  confirmed as the active rebuild service.
- `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` is generated TypeScript cache and intentionally ignored.
